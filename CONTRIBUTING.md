# Contributing to SeqPanther

We encourage the submission of pull requests for bug fixes or the addition of new features. Kindly share or integrate your code, as it can be beneficial for other users.

# Coding Conventions

SeqPanther tries to follow the coding conventions laid out in PEP8 and PEP257.

- http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
- http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

To facilitate style checking, we make use of `black` formatter on the Python code.

# Testing

Tests are required for any new feature or functionality to be considered. Similarly, when addressing a bug fix, we strongly recommend including input data, code, and expected outcomes.

# Continuous Integration

Upon submitting your pull request on GitHub, we will conduct thorough testing. Following validation of the input, code, and expected outputs, the provided code will be merged into the repository.
